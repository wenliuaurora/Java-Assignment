DB Assignment

At first, I am a little confusing about how to save every record into a table. In my opinion,a table just need a ArrayList<Arraylist<String>>. It is easy to change every data, add new one or delete it.So I just write something described in asssignment file.

Record class is a basic class. I did not change much in that class.

Table class is more complexier than Record and it is also the most important class in this assignment.The old version not mention about the table name. And I also forget the key, new version add a function to check the key colum do not have same record. At the same time I write a function to change the key. When I write the Printing class and Database class ,I found I always the size of table and the length of record , so I add these function into Table class. At first, the constructor of table need a Record to build a table. I found it it difficult to use so I make some change for constructor.


In Printing class, I found it is not easy to get every Record's data in table. So I built a Arraylist to save every data which i need to print.And I add a drawtitle function.The old version print many rows in on line, and I change the position of some codes.In this class I learnt may fuctions than java already have , it is so convient to use!

At DBFile class , I searched some java function online. The old version I add Savetitle , Get tabledata function.

The Database I forget to save the old version. I just write it and change and save it many times.Finally it works. The loadfile function is the most difficult to achieve I think.First you need to find these files, and you you should chang these text to Record and add them to Table. Because my Printing class need a table entity, so covert text to table is necessary.

In Table class, I have a arrayList called title for saving the column name. Becase I want think it is useful for my table to remember the type (the extension task).But the time is not enough , I did not finish it.  T.T
